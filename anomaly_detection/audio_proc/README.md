# Stream Sound recording and Anomaly detection

1. Dirs structure: **\sound_rec** **\flac** - converted audio records from wavs
   to flac **\predicted_records** **\record_buffer** **\train_unlabled**

2. Record the training dataset to **audio_proc/sound_rec/train_unlabled/**

   - **commands.py record_single** - from one mic and without anomaly prediction
     thread,

3. Train the iforest model on train dataset
   (**audio_proc/sound_rec/train_unlabled/**) and saving model to
   **train_iforest.onnx**

- **commands.py train_iforest**

4. Stream recording audio samples from 2 mics (\*commands.py record_two**) to
   **audio_proc\sound_rec\record_buffer** and converting to .flac format (per 1
   minute/hour to **\flac\*\*)
